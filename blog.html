          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

          <p>
            The scope of variables in js is determind by the keywords used to
            declare them by var, let and const. Variable declared with var have
            function scope or global scope other side let and const have block
            scope. If var is declared within a function it is accessible withing
            that functions only on the other hand let and const is is only
            accessible within the block. var variables are hoisted to the top of
            their scope on the other hand let and const variables are not
            hoisted to the top of their scope.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            null and undefined are used to represent the absence of a value null
            is often used when the absence is intentional and undefined is used
            as a default or initial value in various contexts. It is generally a
            good practice to use undefined for uninitialized variables and
            function parameters and null when we wanna indicate the absence of a
            value.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            REST APIs are widely used in web development due to their
            simplicity, scalability and the natural fit with the HTTP protocol.
            They are commonly used for building web services that allow
            different applications to communicate with each other over the
            internet. REST APIs are commonly used in web and mobile applications
            for accessing and manipulating data on servers.
